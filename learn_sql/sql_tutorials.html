# difference between Primary Key and Unique Key

1. The primary key is a unique and not-null key that uniquely identifies every record in that table or relationship. The primary key also called a minimal super key.
The unique key is a single column or combination of columns in a table to uniquely identify database records. The unique key also called unique contraints and can be referenced by another table's foreign key.

2. The primary key column cannot store duplicate values that mean primary key columns values are always unique.
The unique key prevents storing duplicate values in the column. A table can contain multiple unique key columns, unlike a primary key column.

3. A primary key can not contain NULL values, whereas a unique key can have NULL values, but only one NULL in allowed in a table.

# difference between Primary Key and Candidate Key

1. The primary key is a unique and not-null key that uniquely identifies every record in that table or relationship. It is also a unique key to identify records in relation or table uniquely.

2. A table or relation can contain only one primary key. A table or relation can have more than one candidate key.

3. A primary key can not contain NULL values, whereas a candidate key can have NULL values.
