# difference between variable and constants

1. Once the constant is defined, it can never be redefined.
A variable can be undefined as well as redefined easily.

2. Constants are the variables whose values can't be changed throughout the program.
The value of the variable can be changed.

3. A constant can only be defined using define() function.
A variable can be defined by simple assignment (=) operator.

4. Constants do not follow any variable scoping rules, and they can be defined and accessed anywhere.
Variables can be declared anywhere in the program, but they follow variable scoping rules.

5. There is no need to use the dollar ($) sign before constant during the assignment.
To declare a variable, always use the dollar ($) sign before the variable.

6. By default, constants are global.
Variables can be local, global, or static.
